AIMS

To be simply the best forms handling module on CPAN. To cope with the oddest situations

COMING SOON

1. Cloning of forms
2. Composition of forms (adding fields from one form to another)
3. Splitting of forms (Partial cloning of forms)

IDEAS

We need ideas for the following:

1. TT integration.
2. Autogeneration from DBIx::Class , particularly in how to cleanly apply constraints on top of generated forms.
3. Inter-field validation
4. Conditional validation

Minors:
1. ::Reset ought not to have a value
2. Debatable whether ::{File,Image} ought to have a value (not echoed, not validated but read)
